## FedVision
**FedVison dataset** is created jointly by WeBank and ExtremeVision to facilitate the advancement of academic research 
and industrial applications of federated learning.

### The FedVision project

* Provides images data sets with standardized annotation for federated object detection.
* Provides key statistics  and systems metrics of the data sets.
* Provides a set of implementations of baseline for further research.

### Datasets
We introduce two realistic federated datasets.
 
* *Federated Street*, a real-world object detection dataset that annotates images captured by a set of street cameras 
based on object present in them, including 7 classes. In this dataset, each or every few cameras serve as a device.

* *Federated River*, a dataset built from images of a set of river cameras. Here, every camera focuses on part of 
a river and each or every few of them serve as a device. The target of this dataset is to locate the garbage on the river. 

 | Dataset | Number of devices | Total samples | Number of class| 
 |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
 | Federated Street |26|956|7|
 | Federated River |44|13398|1|
